## Project Introduction



[FaceNet](https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch)  is a facial recognition system that uses FaceNet PyTorch and Streamlit to build a facial detection application, supporting users to upload videos and automatically detect the position of the face for tracking. This product provides an out-of-the-box FaceNet based on the Huawei Cloud EulerOS 2.0 64-bit system of Kunpeng servers.

## Core Features

- **High precision real-time face detection:** Based on the MTCNN (Multi task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) model, it supports accurate detection of multiple faces in complex scenes, with good robustness and localization accuracy
- **Lightweight and efficient, suitable for edge deployment:** The MTCNN model has a small size and fast inference speed, making it suitable for deployment on resource constrained devices, balancing performance and efficiency

The open-source image product [FaceNet Face Detection and Tracking System](https://marketplace.huaweicloud.com/intl/hidden/contents/b219c88a-056e-43c6-a6ca-efdf9bff525a) provided by this project has pre-installed the the 2.5.3 version of FaceNet and its related runtime environment, and provides deployment templates. Come and refer to the usage guide to easily start an efficient "out-of-the-box" experience!

> **System requirements are as follows:**
